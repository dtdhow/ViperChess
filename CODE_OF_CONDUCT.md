# ViperChess-Mega Community Guidelines
## 1. Be Respectful
No toxicity: Trash-talking about Elo, engine strength, or coding skills isn’t productive.

No spam: Don’t flood issues/PRs with irrelevant content (e.g., "Stockfish is better!!!!1").

## 2. Contribute Constructively
Bug reports? Provide reproducible test positions or FENs.

Feature requests? Explain why it improves the engine (e.g., "Add Syzygy support").

Pull requests? Follow the code style and document changes.

## 3. Credit & Licensing
Borrowed code? Attribute it (e.g., "From Stockfish’s movegen, licensed under GPL-3.0").

Don’t submit closed-source/non-compliant code if the project is GPL.
